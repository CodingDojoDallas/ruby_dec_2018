saturation($color)
lightness($color)
adjust-hue($color, $degrees)
lighten($color, $amount)

complement($color) - returns a complement of a color
invert($color) - returns the inverse of a color
opacity($color) - gets the opacity of a color
opacify($color, $amount - makes a color more opaque
transparentize($color, $amount) - makes a color more transparent
