1. Retrieve all players, then write a program that will loop through each player and display their team name, mascot and stadium. How many queries have we done?
players = Player.all
players.each do |player|
    puts player.name
    puts player.team.name
    puts player.team.mascot
    puts player.team.stadium
end
1 main Query + a Query per player
2. Retrieve all players and write a program to loop through each player and their team name, mascot and stadium using .includes. How many queries have we done now?
players = Player.includes(:team).all
players.each do |player|
    puts player.name
    puts player.team.name
    puts player.team.mascot
    puts player.team.stadium
end
2 queries - 1 for players, 1 for teams
3. Retrieve all players from the 'Chicago Bulls' by using .includes
Player.includes(:team).where("teams.name = 'Chicago Bulls'").references(:team)
4. Retrieve all players along with the team name that play at the 'Staples Center'
Player.joins(:team).where("teams.stadium = 'Staples Center'").select("players.name, teams.name as team_name")
5. Retrieve all teams that have any player that start their name with the letter 'Z' by using .includes and .joins
Team.joins(:players).includes(:players).where("players.name LIKE :prefix", prefix: "Z%")exit
